<div class="quote">I love you.</div>

<div class="quote">If you're so good at abbreviation decoding, then what does this mean? #ILJA&HKBTM. (Ask if you get this and can't decode it)</div>

<div class="quote">I constantly pray for your success in life, happiness, joy, and prosperity.</div>

<div class="quote">Daily reminder I'm MUCH MUCH cooler than you. I don't know why but I just had to let you know. Can't let you get too big of a head here ❤️.</div>

<div class="quote">That 5 million dollar mansion isn't going to buy itself now is it? Stop slacking and get back to grinding.</div>

<div class="quote">I love your smile.</div>

<div class="quote">I love how squishy your cheeks are.</div>

<div class="quote">You know I'm still thinking of your main birthday present (July 2024) I have no idea what to get... Maybe you should drop some hints maybe [you dropped a wax machine which i still think is a weird birthday gift]?</div>

<div class="quote">I love your outgoing personality.</div>

<div class="quote">Yo necesito practicando mi espanol. Esta very rusty indeed, I wanted to make some of these spanish but ya.... not looking good rn</div>

<div class="quote">I love how you like to get things done through your own effort. At times this comes off as hard headed and pointless, but it truly is a trait I find highly attractive within you.</div>

<div class="quote">Despite your self providing and solo initiative nature of wanting to do things by yourself and for yourself do not forget that I am your husband and it's ok to ask things of me when you want or need help/something.</div>

<div class="quote">You belong to me.</div>

<div class="quote">I asked my wife to write out her name and she wrote J######## M####### C####### D# ##### . I find this odd because as far as I know her name is J######## M####### [ Scarlett ].</div>

<div class="quote">Do not forget the fact that if you or I were not awake that night on a game, or awake doing something else, our relationship would not exist. Crazy how that works isn't it? The love of your life could have easily due to a split decision never have known you exist. Cool thought but also makes me extremely grateful to have you as my wife : )</div>

<div class="quote">I seriously love your smile so damn pretty</div>

<div class="quote">I truly do love your open-minded nature. Reason being is all humans are set in their ways and do not even bother hearing things that may conflict with their preconceived notions. However, at least trying to be open to new ideas is something I appreciate about you.</div>

<div class="quote">Guess what my favorite food is? (Hint it is not pizza) ;)</div>

<div class="quote">I love your family as well. Y'all are awesome.</div>

<div class="quote">This is the last message I'll be writing for now. Again I love you, and you only. You'll always be part of my life I can assure you.</div>
